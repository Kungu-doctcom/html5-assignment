# HTML5 Assignment â€” Enhanced Form

This project demonstrates:

- Building a complete HTML5 form with labels, fieldsets, and validation
- Applying HTML5 attributes like required, minlength, pattern, and autocomplete
- Relying on **native HTML5 validation** (no JavaScript)

## How to run
1. Open `enhanced-form.html` in VS Code.
2. Right-click and choose **Open with Live Server** (or click **Go Live** button).
3. Try filling in the form to see HTML5 validation in action.
